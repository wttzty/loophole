## Vulnerability details
The project files of Wanxing Technology's Yitu project management software are actually zip compressed files. Special symbols can be added to project files with special constructions. This will cause files to be released to unexpected directories when opening project files. As the software itself is a qt framework, a specially constructed so file/opt/EdrawProj-2/plugins/imageformats can be released in the qt plugin directory of the installation directory. This way, when the software is run again, exp.so will be loaded, enabling remote code execution.
